Protein Property Calculator Tool version 1
A tool to analyse molecular propertiesof Protein sequences,Identify Signal Peptides
and Compare with Background Dataset

Input:
To run the Program on terminal:
main.py -i set1.txt -d ANDN920101 (set1.txt is an example of input file)
where -i is the input set of sequences
      -d is the property index from AA Index
To upload own property and background file mention:
-p Property file name (default aaindex file)
-b Background file name (default humansequencessp file)

Output:
(1) P-value and plot for the particular index 
    for all sequences from input file 
(2) Parsed result from Phobius indication Signal Peptides 
    and their position
(3) N, H and C region feauture plots

This tool utilizes Phobius(A hidden Markov Model capable of predicting both Transmembrane Topology 
and Signal peptides for detecting Signal Peptides)
